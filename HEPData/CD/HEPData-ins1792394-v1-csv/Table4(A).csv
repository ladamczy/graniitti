#: description: Ratios of integrated cross sections of resonance production to cross sections for f2(1270) production, in the pi+pi- channel.

The results are obtained for the Lorentz-invariant phase-space defined below:
	- $|y(\pi^+\pi^-)| < 0.4$
	- $0.05~\mathrm{GeV}^2 < -t_1, -t_2 < 0.16~\mathrm{GeV}^2$

The experimental systematic uncertainties "(syst.)" are calculated as the quadratic sum of the differences between the nominal fit result and the result of the fit to $d\sigma/dm(\pi^+\pi^-)$ with each systematic effect. The uncertainties related to the extrapolation "(model.)" are quoted as the largest deviation from the nominal fit result.
