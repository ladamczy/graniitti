#: description: Integrated fiducial cross sections with statistical and systematic uncertainties for CEP of $\pi^+\pi^-$, $K^+K^-$ and $p\bar{p}$ pairs in two ranges of azimuthal angle difference, $\Delta\varphi$, between the two forward-scattered protons.

Fiducial region definition:

 * central state

 	- $p_{\mathrm{T}} > 0.2~\mathrm{GeV}$ ($\pi^+$, $\pi^-$)

 	- $p_{\mathrm{T}} > 0.3~\mathrm{GeV}$,   $min(p_{\mathrm{T}}^+, p_{\mathrm{T}}^-) < 0.7~\mathrm{GeV}$ ($K^+$, $K^-$)

 	- $p_{\mathrm{T}} > 0.4~\mathrm{GeV}$,   $min(p_{\mathrm{T}}^+, p_{\mathrm{T}}^-) < 1.1~\mathrm{GeV}$ ($p$, $\bar{p}$)

 	- $|\eta| < 0.7$ (all species)

 * intact forward-scattered beam protons $p'$

 	- $p_x > -0.2~\mathrm{GeV}$

 	- $0.2~\mathrm{GeV} < |p_{y}| < 0.4~\mathrm{GeV}$

 	- $(p_x+0.3~\mathrm{GeV})^2 + p_y^2 < 0.25~\mathrm{GeV}^2$
